# Progress

## What works:
- The project structure is in place, utilizing `index.html` as the main entry point.
- The `index.html` page displays a functional "Handy Dandy" handyman service landing page with a hero section, "Services", "Projects", "Testimonials", and "Contact Form" sections.
- The page includes a responsive header navigation and mobile menu, powered by Alpine.js.
- Styling is consistently applied using Tailwind CSS.
- The core Memory Bank documentation has been initialized and updated to accurately reflect the "Handy Dandy" project's current state, including its use of Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js.

## What's left to build:
- **Content Refinement:** Review and refine all text content (e.g., service descriptions, project details, testimonial text) for clarity, conciseness, and SEO.
- **Image Optimization:** Ensure all images (hero background, project images, testimonial avatars) are optimized for web performance (e.g., compressed, appropriate format like WebP).
- **Contact Form Functionality:** Implement a backend or integrate with a third-party service to handle form submissions from the "Request a Free Estimate" section.
- **Accessibility Improvements:** Conduct an accessibility audit and implement improvements (e.g., ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, proper alt text for all images).
- **SEO Optimization:** Implement meta tags, structured data, and other SEO best practices beyond the initial setup.
- **Deployment:** Prepare the site for deployment to a web server or CDN.

## Current Status:
- **Documentation:** Memory Bank is fully updated and provides a comprehensive understanding of the "Handy Dandy" project, reflecting its current technologies and structure.
- **Codebase:** The project is a functional static landing page, styled with Tailwind CSS and enhanced with Alpine.js for interactivity, ready for content refinement and backend integration for the contact form.

## Known Issues:
- The contact form is currently a static HTML form and does not have backend functionality for submission.

## Evolution of Project Decisions:
- The project has evolved to use Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js for a more streamlined development experience while maintaining a static site architecture.
- The focus remains on simplicity, performance, and ease of maintenance, with future enhancements targeting lead generation and customer engagement through improved content and functional forms.
