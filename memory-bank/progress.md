# Progress

## What works:
- The basic file structure for the "Handy Dandy" project is in place (`index.html`, `css/style.css`, `js/main.js`, `assets/`).
- The `index.html` page displays a functional "Handy Dandy" handyman service landing page with a hero section, "Our Story" (about), "Our Services" (services grid), and "Get In Touch" (contact) sections.
- The page includes a responsive bottom navigation menu.
- The core Memory Bank documentation has been initialized and updated to accurately reflect the "Handy Dandy" project.

## What's left to build:
- **Content Refinement:** Review and refine all text content (e.g., service descriptions, about section) for clarity, conciseness, and SEO.
- **Image Optimization:** Ensure all images in the `assets/` directory are optimized for web performance (e.g., compressed, appropriate format like WebP). The `index.html` has been updated to use a local image path, but the actual image file needs to be placed in `assets/` and optimized.
- **Advanced Interactivity:** If desired, add more complex JavaScript functionality (e.g., a working contact form integration with a third-party service, animations, carousels).
- **Accessibility Improvements:** Conduct an accessibility audit and implement improvements (e.g., ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
- **SEO Optimization:** Implement meta tags, structured data, and other SEO best practices.
- **Deployment:** Prepare the site for deployment to a web server or CDN.

## Current Status:
- **Documentation:** Memory Bank is fully updated and provides a comprehensive understanding of the "Handy Dandy" project.
- **Codebase:** The project is a functional static landing page, ready for content refinement and potential feature enhancements.

## Known Issues:
- None identified at this stage. The existing project is functional as a static site.

## Evolution of Project Decisions:
- The project remains a static site built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, prioritizing simplicity, performance, and ease of maintenance.
- Future decisions will focus on enhancing the existing content and potentially adding features that directly support lead generation and customer engagement, while adhering to the static site architecture.
