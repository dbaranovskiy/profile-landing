# Active Context

## Current Work Focus:
Updating the memory bank for the "Handy Dandy" handyman service landing page project to accurately reflect its current state and purpose.

## Recent Changes:
- Created `memory-bank` directory.
- Initialized core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
- Verified the existing "Handy Dandy" project is functional by launching `index.html` in the browser.
- Updated `projectbrief.md` to describe the "Handy Dandy" handyman service landing page.
- Updated `productContext.md` to describe the "Handy Dandy" handyman service landing page's purpose, problems solved, how it should work, and UX goals.

## Next Steps:
- Update `systemPatterns.md` to accurately describe the architecture and design patterns of the "Handy Dandy" project.
- Update `techContext.md` to outline technologies, development setup, and dependencies specific to the "Handy Dandy" project.
- Update `progress.md` to track the current status, what works, and what's left to build for the "Handy Dandy" project.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- Ensuring all core memory bank files are updated to accurately reflect the "Handy Dandy" project's context.
- The content of these files will continue to evolve as the project progresses and new information becomes available.

## Important Patterns and Preferences:
- Adherence to the specified Memory Bank structure and file hierarchy.
- Documentation should be clear, concise, and easily understandable for future reference.

## Learnings and Project Insights:
- The "Handy Dandy" project is a static HTML/CSS/JS site, which simplifies deployment and maintenance.
- The current task focuses on ensuring the documentation accurately mirrors the existing project, rather than transforming the project itself.
