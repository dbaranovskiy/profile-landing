# Active Context

## Current Work Focus:
Ensuring the memory bank for the "Handy Dandy" handyman service landing page project accurately reflects its current state and purpose, incorporating recent changes to the `index.html` file.

## Recent Changes:
- Created `memory-bank` directory.
- Initialized core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
- Verified the existing "Handy Dandy" project is functional by launching `index.html` in the browser.
- Updated `projectbrief.md` to describe the "Handy Dandy" handyman service landing page.
- Updated `productContext.md` to describe the "Handy Dandy" handyman service landing page's purpose, problems solved, how it should work, and UX goals.
- Updated `techContext.md` to reflect the use of Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js via CDN, and Google Fonts.
- Updated `systemPatterns.md` to reflect the architecture using Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js, and the new section IDs.

## Next Steps:
- Update `progress.md` to track the current status, what works, and what's left to build for the "Handy Dandy" project, based on the current `index.html`.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- Ensuring all core memory bank files are updated to accurately reflect the "Handy Dandy" project's context.
- The content of these files will continue to evolve as the project progresses and new information becomes available.

## Important Patterns and Preferences:
- Adherence to the specified Memory Bank structure and file hierarchy.
- Documentation should be clear, concise, and easily understandable for future reference.

## Learnings and Project Insights:
- The "Handy Dandy" project is a static HTML site utilizing CDNs for Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js, which simplifies development and deployment.
- The current task focuses on ensuring the documentation accurately mirrors the existing project, rather than transforming the project itself.
- The project now includes dedicated sections for "Projects" and "Testimonials" and a "Contact Form" section.
